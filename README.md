# Continental Workshop

Nowadays everyone is able to apply filters to their own pictures, either by using Photoshop or simply Instagram. But how about creating your own filters and editing your pictures programmatically? Join us for an introduction to computer vision, where you'll learn what kind of data exists behind an image and how you can manipulate this data. We'll mainly cover traditional computer vision techniques while exploring exciting applications, such as automatic face detection
